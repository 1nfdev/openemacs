openemacs
===

openemacs is a tiny emacs clone without any library dependencies.

The goal of the project is to implement the most important parts of emacs while staying under 1024 lines of code (as counted by `cloc`).

openemacs is based on Kilo - a minimal editor written by Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez).

The code is released under the 2-clause BSD license.
